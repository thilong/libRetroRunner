libPPSSPP:
    patch EmuThreadStart() in libretro.cpp before test.

    ```
           void EmuThreadStart()
            {
                WARN_LOG(Log::Common, "EmuThread request start: %d", emuThreadState.load());


                bool wasPaused = emuThreadState == EmuThreadState::PAUSED;
                if (!wasPaused)
                {
                    if(emuThreadState == EmuThreadState::START_REQUESTED){
                        WARN_LOG(Log::Common, "EmuThread is starting , ignored.");
                        return;
                    }

                    emuThreadState = EmuThreadState::START_REQUESTED;
                    ctx->ThreadStart();
                    emuThread = std::thread(&EmuThreadFunc);
                    WARN_LOG(Log::Common, "EmuThread start");
                }else{
                    emuThreadState = EmuThreadState::START_REQUESTED;
                }
            }
    ```
